PRIVATEER: Privacy-First Security Analytics for 6G Networks
==========================================================

**Decentralized Robust Security Analytics (WP3)**

PRIVATEER develops innovative privacy-preserving security mechanisms for future 6G networks
through decentralized machine learning approaches. This documentation covers INFILI's core
contributions to anomaly detection and threat classification systems.

Core Components
---------------

The PRIVATEER anomaly detection system implements several key architectural components:

* **Transformer-based Anomaly Detection**: Advanced neural architecture for network traffic analysis
* **Federated Learning Pipeline**: Decentralized training with privacy preservation
* **Differential Privacy**: Formal privacy guarantees through noise injection
* **Adversarial Robustness**: Hardened models resistant to adversarial attacks

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   from privateer_ad.core import TrainPipeline
   from privateer_ad.config import ModelConfig, DataConfig

   # Initialize configuration
   model_config = ModelConfig()
   data_config = DataConfig()

   # Create and run training pipeline
   pipeline = TrainPipeline(model_config, data_config)
   pipeline.run()

Research Context
----------------

This work contributes to **Work Package 3** of the EU Horizon Europe PRIVATEER project,
specifically addressing Task 3.2 (Trustworthy AI model building) under INFILI's leadership.
