            <p>This platform offers an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to analyze and interpret machine learning model behavior through explainable AI techniques such as <strong>SHAP</strong> and <strong>LIME</strong>. You can explore model predictions, detect anomalies, and understand feature contributions across time using the sections available in the left-hand menu.</p>

            <p><strong>üìä Data Analysis</strong> provides a statistical overview of the dataset, helping you understand its distribution before analyzing model explanations.</p>

            <p><strong>üìé Classification Output</strong> displays reconstruction errors per feature and instance. This view is useful for identifying anomalies and understanding model uncertainty across samples.</p>

            <p><strong>üß† XAI Analysis</strong> enables a comparative view of SHAP and LIME explanations across time, highlighting where each method attributes importance and allowing insights into model consistency and sensitivity.</p>

            <p><strong>‚è±Ô∏è Time Series</strong> focuses on the evolution of feature importance across time windows. It includes detailed SHAP and LIME plots that illustrate how input features influence the model at each time point.</p>

            <p><strong>üìå Feature</strong> provides insights into how individual features contribute to predictions and how they evolve temporally. These visualizations help detect which variables are driving the model‚Äôs behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>üìÜ Window</strong> presents the contribution and evolution of entire time windows to the prediction. It helps identify critical temporal segments and observe how features behave during those periods.</p>

            <p><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Settings</strong> page is designed to allow you to generate graphics based on preloaded models, datasets, and instance values. By default, the model and dataset are cached, and the instance is set to 0. You can quickly generate graphics by clicking the "Generate Graphics" button. If you'd like to generate graphics for a different instance, simply input a value greater than 0 in the Instance field, click "Load Instance," and wait for the confirmation that the instance has been loaded. Afterward, you can proceed by clicking "Generate Graphics" to create the visualizations for the selected instance.</p>

            <p>Should you need to change the dataset or model, you can click "Fetch Datasets" to retrieve the available datasets, select your preferred one, and do the same for models by clicking "Fetch Models." Once both the dataset and model are chosen, click "Load Data" to update the configuration and wait for confirmation that the data has been loaded successfully. You can then proceed with selecting your desired instance value and generating the graphics as needed.</p>

            <p>This straightforward process ensures you can seamlessly switch datasets, models, and instance values while generating the necessary visualizations.</p>
